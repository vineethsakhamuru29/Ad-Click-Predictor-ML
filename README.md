# Ad-Click-Predictor-ML
Overview

AdClickPredictorML is a machine learning project developed for predicting user engagement with advertisements. This project aims to optimize ad campaign targeting by leveraging a predictive model trained on a comprehensive advertising dataset. The repository includes code for data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and model training using logistic regression and a random forest classifier.

Project Structure

data: Contains the advertising dataset (advertising.csv) used for training and testing the machine learning model.

notebooks:

media_EDA.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook providing in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the advertising dataset using Python.

Logistic_Regression_Random_Forest.ipynb: Notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, logistic regression, and random forest classifier model training and evaluation.

Requirements

Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook
